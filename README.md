I have collected some of my selected works for display. I will update the list from time to time. 

## branching_diffusion_feymann_kac.pdf
This is my dissertation for my undergraduate at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. In this project, I go through the process of using branching diffusion processes to solve Feynman-Kac formula (or parabolic differential equations in general). My contribution was to extend to the case where the nonlinearity term is an integro-differential operator and identify the correponding marked branching diffusion processes with jumps for a given PDE. I have also explored and verified sufficient conditions for such a correspondence in the smooth density case.
