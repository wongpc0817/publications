I have collected some of my selected works for display. I will update the list from time to time. 

## holistic_kernel.pdf (to be uploaded after published)
We attempt to focus on sparse data using the modified radial basis function neural network in conjunction with density based sample generation algorithm. 

## modified_ilrbf.pdf (to be uploaded after published)
We attempt to apply an incremental density clustering algorithm on a modified radial basis function neural network on classification tasks. By introducing the RBF parameters in the training process, the convergence rate of the training process is improved while sustaining a high level of accuracy in most of our experiments.


## branching_diffusion_feymann_kac.pdf
This is my dissertation for my undergraduate at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. In this project, I go through the process of using branching diffusion processes to solve Feynman-Kac formula (or parabolic differential equations in general). My contribution was to extend to the case where the nonlinearity term is an integro-differential operator and identify the correponding marked branching diffusion processes with jumps for a given PDE. I have also explored and verified sufficient conditions for such a correspondence in the smooth density case.
